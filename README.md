# Capacity Analysis

Custom visualizations made with Python, Jinja2, Javascript, HTML, and CSS that overlays demand in a given quarter (visualized with a weight/heatmap) over a department's capacity (visualized with a thermometer). Visual is grouped in a carousel that slides from left to right using the left or right facing arrows.

Click on the black weight icon (to the right of a Department name and capacity thermometer) to expand into Demand coming from initiatives active in the given quarter):
